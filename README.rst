Consistent Hashing
==================

Practical exercise:

consistent hashing refers to https://github.com/stathat/consistent/blob/master/consistent.go but using CRC64 as checkshum and provides replacable interface for hash function. Also implemented FNV hash function, but it's not balanced while computing key.
